## Definition Statement: ##
I want to build a website to promote physical and mental wellness for mothers who are battling the
effects of perinatal depression and empower them to connect with other local mothers through
the means of walking or light exercise.  Research has shown that exercise as simple as walking
through your community has been shown to reduce postpartum depression symptoms.  Through
exercise and socialization, mothers will realize that they are not alone and can build a network of
other mothers who are also suffering from perinatal depression or those mothers who
have overcame it.

## Definition of Audience: ##
My audience will target pregnant women and mothers who are in their childbearing years who are
suffering from the effects of pre or postpartum depression as well as those survivors of PPD who
have gone through the battle and may be able to offer support or advice.

## â€¢	What is the purpose of my application? ##

To connect women who are suffering or who have suffered from pre or postpartum depression with other
 women who are in a similar circumstance and to empower them to establish a bond with their local
 community of mothers through the power of walking as a form of exercise.

Solving the epidemic of mothers who feel alone and feel as though there are no resources for what
they are going through.  My website will provide that connection and encourage them to meet up and

-	## **Research**: ##
**Welcome to MOPS - MOPS** https://www.mops.org
-	PROS:
-	Itâ€™s bright and inviting
-	Easy to navigate
-	Online option if you want to meet only online
-	CONS:
-	Glitches on menu
-	Information Overload (What is this about again?  Have to visit the about me page to find out or
scroll down more)  Should have very brief statement that tells me what Iâ€™m getting into in the
beginning)
-	 Groups arenâ€™t very robust.  Not sure if they are still active or if they still meet

Moms groups

**Meetup** https://www.meetup.com
-	PROS:
Nothing that I like.
-	CONS:
-	BROKEN LINKS
-	Difficult to navigate to figure out where I can find a LOCAL group
-	Very basic design, nothing that is eyecatching or inviting
-	Group events donâ€™t have descriptions
-	Have to be a member to view certain information
-	Location information box is very buggy.  I typed in my zip code and it displayed groups near
New York City, which I do not live anywhere close to that place.


**Walk Virginia** https://www.walkvirginia.org
-	Very, very basic website.  Not a lot of groups and hard to see if the groups have basic interests
 where I could possibly fit in.
-	Very basic overview
-	(links work which is great)
-	Has a page that will link you to a page to search for trails and events in Virginia


### **Lasagna Love** ###
https://www.lasagnaloveportal.org
-	(How did they set up their form, maybe I can do something like this where the user will fill out
the form and then it gets sent to an email and they get matched to another mother in the area?
This can cut down on privacy)

- Love the form, not sure how I can take this form, populate my own data and utilize this in my
website.
